        This document describes an approach for Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Relying Parties (RPs) to impose locally configured Constraints on cryptographic products subordinate to publicly-trusted Trust Anchors (TAs), as implemented in OpenBSD's rpki-client validator.
        The ability to constrain a Trust Anchor operator's effective signing authority to a limited set of Internet Number Resources (INRs) allows Relying Parties to enjoy the potential benefits of assuming trust - within a bounded scope.

         This document describes an approach for Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Relying Parties (RPs) to impose locally configured Constraints on cryptographic products subordinate to publicly-trusted Trust Anchors (TAs), as implemented in the <xref target="OpenBSD"/> <xref target="rpki-client"/> validator.
        The ability to constrain a Trust Anchor operator's effective signing authority to a limited set of Internet Number Resources (INRs) allows Relying Parties to enjoy the potential benefits of assuming trust - within a bounded scope.
      </t>
      <t>
        It is important to emphasize that each Relying Party makes its Trust Anchor inclusion decisions independently, on its own timelines, based on its own inclusion criteria; and that imposed Constraints (if any) are a matter of local configuration.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document is intended to address user (meaning, Network Operator and Relying Party) needs and concerns, and was authored to benefit users and providers of RPKI services by providing a common body of knowledge to be communicated within the global Internet routing system community.

            In the RPKI hierarchical structure, a Trust Anchor is an authority for which trust is assumed and not derived.
            Assuming trust means that violation of that trust is out-of-scope for the threat model.

          Readers should be familiar with the RPKI, the RPKI repository structure, and the various RPKI objects, uses, and interpretations described in the following: <xref target="RFC3779"/>, <xref target="RFC6480"/>, <xref target="RFC6481"/>, <xref target="RFC6487"/>, and <xref target="RFC6488"/>.
        </t>

    <section anchor="overclaim">
      <name>Considerations on Trust Anchor over-claiming</name>
      <t>
        Currently, all five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) list 'all-resources' (0.0.0.0/0, ::/0, and AS 0-4294967295) as subordinate on their Trust Anchor certificates in order to reduce some potential for risk of invalidation in the case of transient registry inconsistencies <xref target="I-D.rir-rpki-allres-ta-app-statement"/>.
        Such 'all-resources' listings demonstrate that - in the course of normal operations - Trust Anchors may claim authority for INRs outside the registry's current resource holdings.
      </t>
      <t>
        The primary reason for transient registry inconsistencies to occur would be when resources are transferred from one registry to another.
        However, the ability to transfer resources between registries is not universally available: this ability depends on the implementation of registry-specific consensus-driven policy development reciprocated by other registries.
        Another source of churn would be the inflow of new resources following allocations made by the IANA; but because of IPv4 address exhaustion, IPv6 abundance, and 32-bit ASNs being allocated in large blocks - IANA allocations occur far less often than they used to.
      </t>
      <t>
        Absent a registry's ability to execute inter-registry transfers or frequently receive new allocations from IANA, that registry's set of holdings would be a fairly static list of resources.
      </t>
      <t>
        Therefore, a Relying Party need not trust each and every signed product in a derived trust relationship to any and all INRs subordinate to the registry's Trust Anchor, even when the Trust Anchor certificate lists 'all-resources' as subordinate.
        Following the widely deployed information security principle of <xref target="PRIVSEP">least privilege</xref>, constraining a given Trust Anchor's capacity strictly to just that what relates to the their respective current INR holdings, provides some degree of risk reduction for all stakeholders involved.
      </t>
      <t>
        Consequently, knowing a registry's current resource holdings and knowing this set of holdings will not change in the near-term future; following the principle of least privilege, operators can consider applying a restricted-service operating mode towards what otherwise would be an unbounded authority.
        The principle of constraining Trust Anchors might be useful when for example working with RPKI testbeds <xref target="OTE"/>, risky Trust Anchors which cover unallocated space with AS0 ROAs <xref target="AS0TAL"/>, but also in dealings with publicly-trusted registries.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="constraining">
      <name>Constraining Trust Anchors by constraining End-Entity Certificates</name>
      <t>
        As noted in <xref target="overclaim"/>, publicly-trusted RPKI TA certificates are expected to overclaim in the course of normal operations.
        However, applying a bespoke implementation of the certification path validation algorithm to CA certificates to prune all possible certificate paths related to INRs not contained within the locally configured Constraints would not be a trivial task.
        Instead, an alternative and simpler approach operating on EE certificates is proposed.
      </t>
      <t>
        To constrain a Trust Anchor, the IP address and AS number resources listed in a given EE certificate's <xref target="RFC3779"/> extensions MUST be fully contained within the locally configured union set of IP prefixes, IP address ranges, AS identifiers, and AS identifier ranges for which the Relying Party operator anticipates the Trust Anchor operator to issue cryptographic products.
        If a given EE certificate's listed resources are not fully contained within the Constraints, the RP should halt processing and consider the EE certificate invalid.
      </t>
      <t>
        The above described approach applies to all RPKI objects for which an explicit listing of resources is mandated in their respective <xref target="RFC3779"/> extensions; such as BGPSec Router Certificates <xref target="RFC8209"/>, ROAs <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-rfc6482bis"/>, ASPAs <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile"/>, RSCs <xref target="RFC9323"/>, and Geofeeds <xref target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-9092-update"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The approach has no application in context of Signed Objects unrelated to INRs (which thus use 'inherit' elements); such as Ghostbusters records <xref target="RFC6493"/>, Signed TALs <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidrops-signed-tal"/>, and Manifests <xref target="RFC9286"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The validation of Constraint containment is a check in addition to all the validation checks specified in <xref target="RFC6487"/>, <xref target="RFC6488"/>, and each Signed Object's profile specification.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="ops">
      <name>Operational Considerations</name>
      <t>
        When assessing the feasibility of constraining a Trust Anchor's effective signing abilities to the registry's current set of holdings, it is important to take note of existing policies (or lack thereof) and possible future events which might impact the degree of churn in the registry's holdings.
        Examples are:
      </t>
      <t anchor="ARIN-policy">
        The ARIN policy development community abandoned a proposal to allow inter-regional IPv6 resource transfers <xref target="ARIN-2019-4"/>.
        Since it's currently not possible to transfer IPv6 resources from ARIN to any other RIR, ARIN's IANA-allocated IPv6 resources should not appear subordinate to any Trust Anchor other than ARIN's own Trust Anchor.
      </t>
      <t anchor="APNIC-policy">
        The APNIC policy development community has not developed <xref target="APNIC-interrir">policy</xref> to support inter-RIR IPv6 transfers.
      </t>
      <t anchor="LACNIC-policy">
        The LACNIC policy development community has not developed <xref target="LACNIC-interrir">policy</xref> to support inter-RIR IPv6 or ASN transfers.
      </t>
      <t anchor="RIPE-policy">
        The RIPE NCC policy development community has not developed <xref target="RIPE-interrir">policy</xref> to support inter-RIR IPv6 transfers.
      </t>
      <t anchor="AFRINIC-policy">
        AFRINIC has not ratified an inter-registry transfer policy <xref target="AFPUB-2020-GEN-006-DRAFT03"/>.
        The policy proposal indicates implementation is expected to take an additional 12 months after ratification.
        Since it's not possible to transfer resources into AFRINIC, non-AFRINIC resources should not appear subordinate to AFRINIC's Trust Anchor for the foreseeable future.
      </t>
      <t>
        The RIRs collectively manage only a subset of 0.0.0.0/0 <xref target="IANA-IPV4"/> and 2000::/3 <xref target="IANA-IPV6"/>; and have no authority over any parts of 10.0.0.0/8 <xref target="RFC1918"/>, 2001:db8::/32 <xref target="RFC3849"/>, and AS 64512 - 65534 <xref target="RFC6996"/>, for example.
        Since it's not possible to transfer private internet allocations, documentation prefixes, or private use ASNs into an RIR's management, such resources should not appear subordinate to any RIR's Trust Anchor.
      </t>
      <t>
        In recent times IANA has not made allocations from the Current Recovered IPv4 Pool <xref target="IANA-RECOVERED"/>, and Autonomous System Number allocations are also fairly infrequent <xref target="IANA-ASNS"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The aforementioned observations suggest there is a lot of operational runway to manage and distribute Trust Anchor Constraints in a timely manner.
        Maintainers of Constraint lists disseminated as part of an operating system or a third-party software package release process would do well to assume a six month delay for users to update.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security">
      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
        The routing security benefits promised by the RPKI are derived from assuming trust in registry operators to run flawless certification services.
        Assuming such trust exposes users to some potential for <xref target="risks"/> and adverse actions by Certificate Authorities <xref target="RFC8211"/>.
        Restricting a Trust Anchor's effective signing abilities to its respective registry's current holdings - rather assuming unbounded trust in such authorities - is a constructive approach to limit some potential for risk.

        This section contains examples of Constraints listings related to ARIN &amp; AFRINIC managed INRs, and INRs allocated for private or non-public use.
        Constraint suggestions are offered specific to each of the five RIR Trust Anchors.

      <t>
        As it's clumsy and error prone to calculate the complement of a block of resources, for efficiency a simple notation in the form of <strong>allow</strong> and <strong>deny</strong> keywords is used to indicate INRs which may or may not appear subordinate to a Trust Anchor (rather than merely using lengthy exhaustive allowlists of what INRs may appear under a given Trust Anchor).
        Denylist entries (entries prefixed with <strong>deny</strong>) take precedence over allowlist entries (entries prefixed with <strong>allow</strong>).
        Denylist entries may not overlap with other denylist entries.
        Allowlist entries may not overlap with other allowlist entries.
        The ordering of entries is not significant.

          The below listing is intended to be an exhaustive list of Constraints related to AFRINIC-managed Internet Number Resources.
          Inter-RIR resource transfers aren't possible into and out of the AFRINIC registry.

          By placing the below contents in a file named <strong>afrinic.constraints</strong> next to a Trust Anchor Locator file named <strong>afrinic.tal</strong>, the <xref target="rpki-client"/> implementation will consider all End-Entity certificates invalid which list resources not fully contained within the resources listed in the <strong>afrinic.constraints</strong> file.

        <t>
          Most of the below constraints relate to IP addresses and ASNs which are not globally unique and not managed by any RIR, as such these INRs are not expected to appear subordinate to any publicly-trusted Trust Anchor.
          LACNIC ASNs cannot be transferred to ARIN.
          Finally, since inter-RIR transfers involving ARIN may not include IPv6 addresses; ARIN's Trust Anchor is constrained to just its own IANA allocated IPv6 blocks.
