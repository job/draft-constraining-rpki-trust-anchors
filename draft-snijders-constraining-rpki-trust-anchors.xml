      <t>
        This document describes an approach for Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Relying Parties (RPs) to impose locally configured constraints on cryptographic products subordinate to publicly-trusted externally operated Trust Anchors (TAs), as implemented in OpenBSD's rpki-client validator.
        The capability to effectively constrain a Trust Anchor operator's signing authority to a limited set of Internet Number Resources (INRs), allows Relying Parties to enjoy the potential benefits of assuming trust within a bounded scope.

      <t>
         This document describes an approach for Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Relying Parties (RPs) to impose locally configured constraints on cryptographic products subordinate to publicly-trusted externally operated Trust Anchors (TAs), as implemented in the <xref target="OpenBSD"/> <xref target="rpki-client"/> validator.
         The capability to effectively constrain a Trust Anchor operator's abilities to a limited set of Internet Number Resources (INRs), allows Relying Parties to enjoy the potential benefits of assuming trust within a bounded scope.
      </t>

      <t>
        It is important to emphasize that each Relying Party makes its Trust Anchor inclusion decisions independently, on its own timelines, based on its own inclusion criteria; and that imposed constraints (if any) are a matter of local configuration.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document is intended to address user (meaning, Network Operator and Relying Party) needs and concerns, and was authored to benefit users and providers of RPKI services by providing a common body of knowledge to be communicated within the global Internet routing system community.

            In the RPKI hierarchical structure, a Trust Anchor is an authority for which trust is assumed and not derived.
            Assuming trust means that violation of that trust is out-of-scope for the threat model.

          <dd>
            Derived Trust can be automatically and securely computed with subjective logic.
            In the context of the RPKI, trust is derived according to the rules for validation of RPKI Certificates and Signed Objects.

          Readers should be familiar with the RPKI, the RPKI repository structure, and the various RPKI objects, uses, and interpretations described in the following: <xref target="RFC3779"/>, <xref target="RFC6480"/>, <xref target="RFC6481"/>, <xref target="RFC6487"/>, and <xref target="RFC6488"/>.

      <name>Considerations on Trust Anchor over-claiming</name>
      <t>
        Currently, all five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) list 'all-resources' (0.0.0.0/0, ::/0, and AS 0-4294967295) as subordinate on their Trust Anchor certificates in order to reduce some potential for risk of invalidation in the case of transient registry inconsistencies <xref target="I-D.rir-rpki-allres-ta-app-statement"/>.
        Such 'all-resources' listings demonstrate that - in the course of normal operations - Trust Anchors may claim authority for INRs outside the registry's current resource holdings.
      </t>
      <t>
        The primary reason for transient registry inconsistencies to occur would be when resources are transferred from one registry to another.
        However, the ability to transfer resources between registries is not universally available: this ability depends on the implementation of registry-specific consensus-driven policy development reciprocated by other registries.
        Another source of churn would be the inflow of new resources following allocations made by the IANA; but because of IPv4 address exhaustion, IPv6 abundance, and 32-bit ASNs being allocated in large blocks - IANA allocations occur far less often than they used to.
      </t>
      <t>
        Absent a registry's ability to execute inter-registry transfers or frequently receive new allocations from IANA, that registry's set of holdings would be a fairly static list of resources.
      </t>
      <t>
        Therefore, a Relying Party need not trust each and every signed product in a derived trust relationship to any and all INRs subordinate to the registry's Trust Anchor; even if the Trust Anchor certificate lists 'all-resources' as subordinate.
        Following the widely deployed information security principle of <xref target="priv">least privilage</xref>, constraining a given Trust Anchor's capacity strictly to just that what relates to the their respective current INR holdings, provides some degree of risk reduction for all stakeholders involved.
      </t>
      <t>
        Consequently, knowing a registry's current resource holdings and knowing this set of holdings will not change in the near-term future; following the principle of least privilege, operators can consider applying a restricted-service operating mode towards what otherwise would be an unbounded authority.
        The principle of constraining Trust Anchors might be useful when working with RPKI testbeds <xref target="OTE"/>, but also in dealings with publicly-trusted registries.

        For example, AFRINIC has not yet ratified an inter-registry transfer policy <xref target="AFPUB-2020-GEN-006-DRAFT03"/>, and this policy proposal indicates that implementation is expected to take 12 months after ratification.
        IANA has not made allocations from the Current Recovered IPv4 Pool <xref target="recovered"/> in recent times, and Autonomous System Number allocations are also fairly infrequent <xref target="asns"/>.
