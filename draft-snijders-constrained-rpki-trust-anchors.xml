    <abstract>
      <t>
        This document describes an approach for Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Relaying Parties (RPs) to impose locally configured constraints on cryptographic products subordinate to publicly-trusted externally operated Trust Anchors (TAs), as implemented in OpenBSD's rpki-client validator.
        The capacity to effectively constrain a Trust Anchor operator's abilities to a limited set of Internet Number Resources (INRs), allows Relying Parties to enjoy the potential benefits of assuming trust within a bounded scope.

      <t>
         This document describes an approach for Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Relaying Parties (RPs) to impose locally configured constraints on cryptographic products subordinate to publicly-trusted externally operated Trust Anchors (TAs), as implemented in the <xref target="OpenBSD"/> <xref target="rpki-client"/> validator.
         The capacity to effectively constrain a Trust Anchor operator's abilities to a limited set of Internet Number Resources (INRs), allows Relying Parties to enjoy the potential benefits of assuming trust within a bounded scope.
      </t>

      <t>
        It is important to emphasize that each Relying Party makes its Trust Anchor inclusion decisions independently, on its own timelines, based on its own inclusion criteria; and that imposed constraints (if any) are a matter of local configuration.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document is intended to address user (meaning, Network Operator and Relying Party) needs and concerns, and was authored to benefit users and providers of RPKI services by providing a common body of knowledge to be communicated within the global Internet routing system community.

          <dt>Assumed Trust</dt>
          <dd>
            In the RPKI hierarchical structure, a Trust Anchor is an authority for which trust is assumed and not derived.
            Assuming trust means that violation of that trust is out-of-scope for the threat model.
          </dd>
          <dt>Derived Trust</dt>
          <dd>
            Derived Trust can be automatically and securely computed with subjective logic.
            In the context of the RPKI, trust is derived according to the rules for validation of RPKI Certificates and Signed Objects.

      <t>
        Below is an example list of constraints related to AFRINIC-managed Internet Number Resources.
        By placing the below contents in a file named <strong>afrinic.constraints</strong> next to a Trust Anchor Locator file named <strong>afrinic.tal</strong>, the rpki-client implementation will consider all End-Entity certificates invalid which carry INRs not fully contained within the INRs listed in the <strong>afrinic.constraints</strong> file.
